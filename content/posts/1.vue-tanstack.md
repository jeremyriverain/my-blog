# Discovering the TanStack Table library with VueJS

[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table) is a headless library for building tables. In this article, I will show you how you can leverage its power with VueJS.

This article is not a complete guide. To be exhaustive, it would be necessary to write a very long article. Moreover, I recently discovered the TanStack library, its possibilities, and I'm not an expert. My ambition is rather to share with the community what I learned so far.

## What is TanStack Table ?

[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table) is a **headless** library for building tables, meaning it does not provide any HTML markup or any design. Instead, its role is to provide the logic, the state and a full-featured API to make your own table, from the simplest use case to the most complicated.

Since the library does not provide any markup, its bundle size is lightweight (10 - 15kb gzipped).

Among the features provided by this library, there is all the logical pieces you need to make a table, like API for filtering, sorting, grouping, paginating and displaying datasets.

The library is framework-agnostic and there is an [adapter for VueJS](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/adapters/vue-table).
