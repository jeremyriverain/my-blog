# How to execute Flutter integration tests in GitHub Action ?

When you write Flutter integration tests, you have different options to run them on Github Action. You can use a third-party service like the [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab) or you can run these tests on emulators (iOS or Android) that you set up. In my last personal project, I chose this last option and I searched a lot on the internet before finding a solution. So here is an article that demonstrates what I learned and what I did to make it work.

## Prepare your environment

To follow this tutorial, you must have Flutter installed. If so, please run `flutter doctor` to verify that your environment is set up correctly.

Obviously, to run the tests on Github Action, you need a Github account.

## Create your project

Create a Flutter project by using the *skeleton* template. It scaffolds an application with a List View and a Detail View:

::terminal
---
content:
  - flutter create flutter_project --template=skeleton
  - cd flutter_project
---
::

Create an empty repository on Github:

![create project on Github](https://a.storyblok.com/f/88570/1264x1844/39ec134890/screenshot-2022-04-17-at-21-19-22.png)

Then, push the project's source code to Github:

::terminal
---
content:
  - git init
  - git checkout -b main
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "create flutter project"
  - git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<project_name>.git
  - git push -u origin main
---
::

## Write some integration tests

We need the [integration_test](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/packages/integration_test) and [flutter_test](https://pub.dev/packages/test) packages to write integration tests. Add these dependencies to the `dev_dependencies` section of the app‚Äôs `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml

dev_dependencies:
  integration_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

Then install the dependencies:

::terminal
---
content:
  flutter pub get
---
::

Create a new directory, `integration_test`, with an empty `app_test.dart` file. Now we can write some tests:

```dart
// integration_test/app_test.dart

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';

import 'package:flutter_project/main.dart' as app;

void main() {
  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  group('end-to-end test', () {
    testWidgets('go to the list and detail views', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      app.main();
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      expect(find.text('Sample Items'), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.textContaining('SampleItem'), findsNWidgets(3));

      final Finder sampleItem = find.text('SampleItem 1');

      await tester.tap(sampleItem);

      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      expect(find.text('Item Details'), findsOneWidget);
    });
  });
}
```

Run these tests to verify that they pass:

::terminal
---
content:
  - flutter test integration_test/
---
::

## Create a Github workflow

Now, we need to configure our CI on Github Action. For this, we will define a workflow, composed of 2 different jobs: one responsible for running tests on iOS devices and the second for running them on Android devices.

Create a file named `main.yml` in the `.github/workflows`directory:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml

# Name of your workflow.
name: main

# Trigger the workflow manually or after push a commit
on: [push, workflow_dispatch]

# 2 jobs are configured.
# The first one runs tests on iOS devices.
# The second runs tests on Android devices
jobs:

  # job responsible for running Flutter tests on iOS devices
  ios:
    # Creates a build matrix for your jobs. You can define different variations of an environment to run each job
    strategy:
      matrix:
        device:
          # The available simulators are listed by the "xcrun xctrace list devices" command
          - "iPhone 11 Simulator (15.2)" # the name of the simulator could be different depending on the macos version you are using
      # if one of the jobs in the matrix expansion fails, the rest of the jobs will be cancelled
      fail-fast: true
    runs-on: macos-11 # or macos-latest if you prefer, but be aware that the available simulators could be different if you run a different version
    steps:
      - name: "List all simulators"
        run: "xcrun xctrace list devices"
      - name: "Start Simulator"
        # the command "xcrun simctl boot" expects a device identifier
        # the assignment of the UDID variable consists of retrieving the ID of the simulator
        # by extracting it from the command "xcrun xctrace list devices"
        run: |
          UDID=$(xcrun xctrace list devices | grep "^${{ matrix.device }}" | awk '{gsub(/[()]/,""); print $NF}')
          echo $UDID
          xcrun simctl boot "${UDID:?No Simulator with this name found}"
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Flutter SDK
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: stable
          # instead of "channel: stable", you could be more precise by specifying the exact version of Flutter you're using:
          # flutter-version: '<FLUTTER_VERSION>'
      - name: Install Flutter dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: flutter test integration_test --verbose

  # job responsible for running Flutter tests on Android devices
  android:
    runs-on: macos-11
    strategy:
      matrix:
        api-level:
          - 29
          # you can add more API level if you want to run your tests on different API
      fail-fast: true
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Flutter SDK
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: stable
          # instead of "channel: stable", you could be more precise by specifying the exact version of Flutter you're using:
          # flutter-version: '<FLUTTER_VERSION>'
      - name: Install Flutter dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      - name: Run integration tests
        # more info on https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner
        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2
        with:
          api-level: ${{ matrix.api-level }}
          arch: x86_64
          profile: Nexus 6
          script: flutter test integration_test --verbose
```

Then, commit and push your work:

::terminal
---
content:
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "write some tests and setup CI"
  - git push
---
::

Finally go to the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù tab on Github. You can see your actions are running and performed successfully. Congrats ! ü•≥
